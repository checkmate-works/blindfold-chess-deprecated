# Algebraic Notation Basics

## Introduction

Algebraic notation is the standard method for recording chess moves. For blindfold chess, mastering this notation system is absolutely essential as it's your primary way to communicate moves without seeing the board.

## The Chessboard Grid

The chessboard is an 8×8 grid with a unique coordinate system:

- **Files (columns)**: Labeled **a** through **h** from left to right
- **Ranks (rows)**: Numbered **1** through **8** from White's side to Black's side

Each square has a unique identifier combining its file and rank (e.g., e4, d7, a1).

## Piece Abbreviations

| Piece | Symbol | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| King | **K** | Ke2 |
| Queen | **Q** | Qd8 |
| Rook | **R** | Ra1 |
| Bishop | **B** | Bf4 |
| Knight | **N** | Nf3 |
| Pawn | *(no symbol)* | e4 |

> **Note**: Knight uses 'N' to avoid confusion with King

## Basic Move Notation

### Simple Moves
- **e4**: Pawn moves to e4
- **Nf3**: Knight moves to f3
- **Be5**: Bishop moves to e5

### Captures
- **Bxe5**: Bishop captures on e5
- **exd5**: Pawn on e-file captures on d5
- **Qxf7+**: Queen captures on f7 with check

### Special Notations
- **O-O**: Kingside castling (short castling)
- **O-O-O**: Queenside castling (long castling)
- **e8=Q**: Pawn promotes to Queen
- **+**: Check
- **#**: Checkmate

## Disambiguation

When two pieces of the same type can move to the same square, we add extra information:

### File Disambiguation
- **Nbd2**: Knight from b-file to d2 (when another knight could also reach d2)
- **Rfe1**: Rook from f-file to e1

### Rank Disambiguation
- **N3e5**: Knight from rank 3 to e5
- **R1a3**: Rook from rank 1 to a3

### Full Disambiguation
- **Qd1e2**: Queen from d1 to e2 (very rare)

## Advanced Symbols

- **!**: Good move
- **!!**: Brilliant move
- **?**: Mistake
- **??**: Blunder
- **!?**: Interesting move
- **?!**: Dubious move
- **=**: Position is equal
- **±**: White has a clear advantage
- **∓**: Black has a clear advantage

## Reading Full Games

A typical game might start:
```
1. e4 e5
2. Nf3 Nc6
3. Bb5 a6
4. Ba4 Nf6
5. O-O Be7
```

Each numbered line shows one complete move (White's move followed by Black's move).

## Tips for Blindfold Chess

1. **Practice out loud**: Say moves aloud to reinforce memory
2. **Visualize the path**: Before announcing a move, trace the piece's path mentally
3. **Use full notation**: In blindfold chess, always specify the destination square clearly
4. **Confirm captures**: Double-check capture notation to avoid confusion
5. **Master common patterns**: Recognize standard opening moves like "e4, d4, Nf3, Nc3"

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- **Forgetting piece symbols**: Remember pawns have no symbol
- **Wrong castling notation**: It's "O-O" not "0-0" (letter O, not zero)
- **Ambiguous moves**: Always disambiguate when necessary
- **Mixing up files and ranks**: Files are letters, ranks are numbers
